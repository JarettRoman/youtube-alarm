Youtube Alarm Clock
==

Learning Ruby on Rails by making an application to wake myself up in the morning! My current alarm clock is boring, and I don't feel like downloading music onto my phone for an alarm, so this will have to do!

TODO:
- Create a page for vistors.
- Allow for a visitor to set a time for an alarm.
- Allow for a visitor to input a Youtube video ID to locate said video.
- Have the video play automatically once the alarm goes off.
